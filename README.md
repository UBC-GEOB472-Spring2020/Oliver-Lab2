Reflection:This map shows all motorcycle parking spaces in the Vancouver area. The search box can show results according to the area you search, but currently only supports searching the following areas: Downtown, Mount Pleasant
, Grandview-Woodland, Fairview, Kitsilano, Strathcona, Riley Park, West End
Kensington-Cedar, Cottage, Sunset, Killarney, Dunbar-Southlands, Renfrew-Collingwood, South Cambie, West Point Grey, Arbutus-Ridge, Kerrisdale, Marpole, Hastings-Sunrise 
It does not support searching for specific street names and the serach box is not case sensitive.This part still needs an improvement.
The second button is to highlighted metered parking space.It could help audience quickly find a metered parking space. 
The third button is to reset the map. 
The last function of the map is when you click a point which represent a parking space, it will show the start time and end time you want to park. After you enter the time, click the calculate button, it will show the total parking fee.
The price varies according to the time period. After continuous testing, the map can display the parking fee correctly.
Now the map only support to calculated metered parking space and this is why I put a Highlighted metered parking button on the map.

This map is designed for people who ride monocycle. Although it is easy to find a parking space for people who drive monocycle, it is still hard to find one during the rush hour. Therefore, finding a parking space only motorcycle is necessary. The map will show all motorcycle parking space in Vancouver area. The motorcycle does not have many space to carry many small changes so before the people leave their home, they could use this map to find a parking space and know how many coins they need to use. It might be useful.
Because I ride a motorcycle, I come up this idea and draw such a map. After finding the data, I sorted the data and try to find which parts could be visualized . The first two functions are relatively easy to implement, but the Calculation of the parking fee is more complicated. It took me a long time to test this algorithm and I believe the results now on the map should be correct.
